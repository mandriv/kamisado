Instructions for Task 3
---

The details of Task 3 are on the course webpage.  These instructions
are only to explain how to submit the task once you have completed
it.  There are two parts to submit this task.

 * The most important thing is to demo your programme to the lab
   demonstrator during your lab time.
 * Also you need to submit the source code as demo'd.

All the Java source files will be in "src" sub-tree if you used the
standard Eclipse project layout.  (If you didn't it's time to move all
the Java source files to "src"...).  Make sure your documents are up
to date -- probably just the autogenerated UML files.

1.  git add all the java files
2.  Commit and push 

        git commit -a -m"Source code at time of demo"
        git push

3.  Push a new branch for submission.
        
        git checkout -b submit-task3
        git push origin submit-task3
        git checkout master

(I'm assuming you are working on the master branch -- if not
substitute the branch you are working on for master)

Instructions for Task 1
---

The details of Task 1 are on the course webpage.  These instructions
are only to explain how to submit the task once you have completed it.

For Task 1 you must produce a PDF of the requirements.  It must be
called "requirements.pdf" and it must be placed in the directory
"docs/reqs/" which has been helpfully created for you.

As you have practiced in Prac 0 you will submit this file using
gitlab, via a special branch in the repository.  Once you have
completed the work, make sure to commit everything and push it to the
server.  E.g.
        
        git commit -a -m"Final changes to requirements doc"
        git push
        
Remember to add the file "requirements.pdf" otherwise it won't be
included in the commit!  If you're happy with the work, you can submit
it by creating and pushing the branch "submit-task1"
        
        git checkout -b submit-task1
        git push origin submit-task1
        git checkout master

(I'm assuming you are working on the master branch -- if not
substitute the branch you are working on for master)
